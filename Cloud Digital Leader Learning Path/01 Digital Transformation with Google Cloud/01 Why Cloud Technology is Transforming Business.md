# Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business

1. **What is seen as a limitation of on-premises infrastructure, when compared to cloud infrastructure?**

   - The on-premises hardware procurement process can take a long time.

2. **An organization has made significant investments in their own infrastructure and has regulatory requirements for their data to be hosted on-premises. Which cloud implementation would best suit their needs?**

   - **Private Cloud**

3. **Select the two capabilities that form the basis of a transformation cloud. Select two correct answers.**

   - **Open infrastructure** gives the freedom to innovate by running applications in the place that makes the most sense.
   - **Data cloud** provides a unified solution to manage data across the entire data lifecycle.

4. **Which item describes a goal of an organization seeking digital transformation?**

   - **Break down data silos and generate real-time insights.**

5. **As the world and business changes, organizations have to decide between embracing new technology and transforming, or keeping their technology and approaches the same. What risks might an organization face by not transforming as their market evolves?**

   - **Focusing on ‘how’ they operate** can prevent organizations from seeing transformation opportunities.

6. **Select the definition of digital transformation.**

   - **When an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer experiences.**

7. **An organization has a new application, and user subscriptions are growing faster than on-premises infrastructure can handle. What benefit of the cloud might help them in this situation?**

   - **It's scalable**, so the organization could shorten their infrastructure deployment time.

8. **What is the cloud?**

   - A **metaphor for a network of data centers.**

9. **What is the benefit of implementing a transformation cloud that is based on open infrastructure?**

   - **Open source software reduces the chance of vendor lock-in.**
